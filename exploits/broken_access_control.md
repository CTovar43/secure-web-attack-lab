# Broken Access Control – Admin Page Exposure

## Summary
The admin dashboard is accessible without authentication or authorization, exposing sensitive user data.

## Affected Endpoint
- GET /admin

## Root Cause
The admin route does not verify:
- User authentication
- User role (admin vs normal user)

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
1. Log out of the application
2. Navigate directly to `/admin`

## Result
Administrative data is disclosed to unauthenticated users.

## Impact
- Information disclosure
- User enumeration
- Privacy violations
- Potential targeting of privileged accounts

## Severity
High

## Recommended Fix
- Require authentication
- Enforce role-based access control (RBAC)
- Deny access by default
