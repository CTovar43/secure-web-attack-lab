# SQL Injection – Authentication Bypass

## Summary
The login endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication without valid credentials.

## Affected Endpoint
- POST /login

## Root Cause
User-controlled input is concatenated directly into an SQL query without parameterization.

```python
query = f"SELECT id, username, role FROM users WHERE username = '{username}' AND password = '{password}'"
```

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
1. Username
``` python
' OR '1'='1
```
2. Password
- anything

## Result
The application authenticates the attacker as an existing user without a valid password.

## Impact
- Complete authentication bypass
- Privilege escalation (potential admin access)
- Full compromise of user accounts

## Severity
Critical

## Recommended Fix
- Use parameterized queries
- Never concatenate user input into SQL statements
